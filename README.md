# Solaris-XIL-!

Utilized our multidisciplinary team tasked with developing a **next-generation regional passenger aircraft** targeting **market entry by 2040**.
The project emphasized **innovation in aerodynamic efficiency**, sustainability, and **economic feasibility** within evolving aviation markets.

🎯 Task
Aerodynamics: 
- **Performed aerodynamic analyses** using conceptual design tools and empirical methods to optimize lift-to-drag ratios and cruise efficiency
- Evaluating aerodynamic performance metrics for fixed-wing configurations
- Contributed to power system analysis.
  
Cost:
- Conducting **cost modeling** to assess production and operational viability  
- Collaborating with business and engineering teams to align performance goals with market strategy

🎉 Result
- Produced a **validated conceptual aircraft design** balancing aerodynamic performance and cost-effectiveness for future regional markets  
- Demonstrated **cross-functional collaboration** between engineering and business disciplines
